# AwardsTwo
## About
### What happened to Awards One?
I built AwardsOne in 2015. It was comprised of two systems: an Entry system, and a Judging system. Both sharing the same database to talk to each other. 

### So what's next?
Over the last 18 months I've learnt a lot more about frameworks and building an application for a framework. I also particulary want to practice my [Laravel 5](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/). So I want to recreate AwardsOne from scratch built in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/).

### On your own?
Mostly, but I want to keep the codebase open so that you can help and submit pull requests to either add features, or improve code that I have written.
